The IRC protocol itself enables several possibilities of transferring
data between clients, and just like with other transfer mechanisms
like email, the receiver of the data has to be careful about how the
data is handled. For more information on security issues with the IRC
protocol, see for example http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/security/.

<b>Abstract</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
The IRC (Internet Relay Chat) protocol is for use with text based
conferencing; the simplest client being any socket program capable of
connecting to the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>.
<p>
This document defines the Client Protocol, and assumes that the
reader is familiar with the IRC Architecture [IRC-ARCH].

This section defines the identifiers used for the various components
of the IRC protocol.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>1.1 Servers</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Servers are uniquely identified by their name, which has a maximum
length of sixty three (63) characters. See the protocol grammar
rules (section 2.3.1) for what may and may not be used in a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>
name.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>1.2 Clients</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
For each client all servers MUST have the following information: a
netwide unique identifier (whose format depends on the type of
client) and the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> which introduced the client.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>1.2.1 Users</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Each user is distinguished from other users by a unique <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>
having a maximum length of nine (9) characters.  See the protocol
grammar rules (section 2.3.1) for what may and may not be used in a
<a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>.
<p>
While the maximum length is limited to nine characters, clients
SHOULD accept longer strings as they may become used in future
evolutions of the protocol.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>1.2.1.1 Operators</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
To allow a reasonable amount of order to be kept within the IRC
network, a special <a href="class_object.html">class</a> of users (<a href="doc_operators.html">operators</a>) is allowed to perform
general maintenance <a href="doc_kvs_aliasesandfunctions.html">functions</a> on the network.  Although the powers
granted to an <a href="doc_operators.html">operator</a> can be considered as 'dangerous', they are
nonetheless often necessary.  <a href="doc_operators.html">Operators</a> SHOULD be able to perform
basic network tasks such as disconnecting and reconnecting servers as
needed.  In recognition of this need, the protocol discussed herein
provides for <a href="doc_operators.html">operators</a> only to be able to perform such <a href="doc_kvs_aliasesandfunctions.html">functions</a>.
See sections 3.1.8 (SQUIT) and 3.4.7 (CONNECT).<br>
<p>
A more controversial power of <a href="doc_operators.html">operators</a> is the ability to remove a
user from the connected network by 'force', i.e., <a href="doc_operators.html">operators</a> are able
to close the connection between any client and <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>.  The
justification for this is very delicate since its abuse is both
destructive and annoying, and its benefits close to inexistent.  For
further details on this type of action, see section 3.7.1 (KILL).
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>1.2.2 Services</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Each service is distinguished from other services by a service name
composed of a <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> and a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> name.  As for users, the <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>
has a maximum length of nine (9) characters.  See the protocol
grammar rules (section 2.3.1) for what may and may not be used in a
<a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>1.3 Channels</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="doc_ircintro.html">Channels</a> names are strings (beginning with a '&', '#', '+' or '!'
character) of length up to fifty (50) characters.  Apart from the
requirement that the first character is either '&', '#', '+' or '!',
the only restriction on a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> name is that it SHALL NOT contain
any spaces (' '), a control G (^G or ASCII 7), a comma (',').  Space
is used as parameter separator and command is used as a list item
separator by the protocol).  A colon (':') can also be used as a
delimiter for the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> mask.  <a href="doc_ircintro.html">Channel</a> names are case insensitive.
See the protocol grammar rules (section 2.3.1) for the exact syntax
of a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> name.<br>
<p>
Each prefix characterizes a different <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> type.  The definition
of the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> types is not relevant to the client-server protocol
and thus it is beyond the scope of this document.  More details can
be found in "Internet Relay Chat: <a href="doc_ircintro.html">Channel</a> Management" [IRC-CHAN].

<b>2. The IRC Client Specification</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>2.1 Overview</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
The protocol as described herein is for use only with client to
<a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> connections when the client registers as a user.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>2.2 Character codes</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
No specific character set is specified. The protocol is based on a
set of codes which are composed of eight (8) bits, making up an
octet.  Each message may be composed of any number of these octets;
however, some octet values are used for control codes, which act as
message delimiters.<br>
<p>
Regardless of being an 8-bit protocol, the delimiters and keywords
are such that protocol is mostly usable from US-ASCII terminal and a
telnet connection.
<p>
Because of IRC's Scandinavian origin, the characters {}|^ are
considered to be the lower case equivalents of the characters []\~,
respectively. This is a critical issue when determining the
equivalence of two <a href="doc_ircintro.html">nicknames</a> or <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> names.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>2.3 Messages</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Servers and clients send each other messages, which may or may not
generate a reply.  If the message contains a valid command, as
described in later sections, the client should expect a reply as
specified but it is not advised to wait forever for the reply; client
to <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> and <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> to <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> communication is essentially
asynchronous by nature.
<p>
Each IRC message may consist of up to three main parts: the prefix
(OPTIONAL), the command, and the command parameters (maximum of
fifteen (15)).  The prefix, command, and all parameters are separated
by one ASCII space character (0x20) each.
<p>
The presence of a prefix is indicated with a single leading ASCII
colon character (':', 0x3b), which MUST be the first character of the
message itself.  There MUST be NO gap (whitespace) between the colon
and the prefix.  The prefix is used by servers to indicate the true
origin of the message.  If the prefix is missing from the message, it
is assumed to have originated from the connection from which it was
received from.  Clients SHOULD NOT use a prefix when sending a
message; if they use one, the only valid prefix is the registered
<a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> associated with the client.
<p>
The command MUST either be a valid IRC command or a three (3) digit
number represented in ASCII text.
<p>
IRC messages are always lines of characters terminated with a CR-LF
(Carriage Return - Line Feed) pair, and these messages SHALL NOT
exceed 512 characters in length, counting all characters including
the trailing CR-LF. Thus, there are 510 characters maximum allowed
for the command and its parameters.  There is no provision for
continuation of message lines.  See section 6 for more details about
current implementations.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>2.3.1 Message format in Augmented BNF</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
The protocol messages must be extracted from the contiguous stream of
octets.  The current solution is to designate two characters, CR and
LF, as message separators.  Empty messages are silently ignored,
which permits use of the sequence CR-LF between messages without
extra problems.
<p>
The extracted message is parsed into the components &lt;prefix&gt;,
&lt;command&gt; and list of parameters (&lt;params&gt;).
<p>
<pre>
    The Augmented BNF representation for this is:
    message    =  [ ":" prefix SPACE ] command [ params ] crlf
    prefix     =  servername / ( <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> [ [ "!" user ] "@" host ] )
    command    =  1*letter / 3digit
    params     =  *14( SPACE middle ) [ SPACE ":" trailing ]
               =/ 14( SPACE middle ) [ SPACE [ ":" ] trailing ]
    nospcrlfcl =  %x01-09 / %x0B-0C / %x0E-1F / %x21-39 / %x3B-FF
                    ; any octet except NUL, CR, LF, " " and ":"
    middle     =  nospcrlfcl *( ":" / nospcrlfcl )
    trailing   =  *( ":" / " " / nospcrlfcl )
    SPACE      =  %x20        ; space character
    crlf       =  %x0D %x0A   ; "carriage return" "linefeed"
   NOTES:
      1) After extracting the parameter list, all parameters are equal
         whether matched by &lt;middle&gt; or &lt;trailing&gt;. &lt;trailing&gt; is just a
         syntactic trick to allow SPACE within the parameter.
      2) The NUL (%x00) character is not special in message framing, and
         basically could end up inside a parameter, but it would cause
         extra complexities in normal C string handling. Therefore, NUL
         is not allowed within messages.
   Most protocol messages specify additional semantics and syntax for
   the extracted parameter strings dictated by their position in the
   list.  For example, many <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> commands will assume that the first
   parameter after the command is the list of targets, which can be
   described with:
  target     =  <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> / <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>
  msgtarget  =  msgto *( "," msgto )
  msgto      =  <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> / ( user [ "%" host ] "@" servername )
  msgto      =/ ( user "%" host ) / targetmask
  msgto      =/ <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> / ( <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> "!" user "@" host )
  <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a>    =  ( "#" / "+" / ( "!" channelid ) / "&" ) chanstring
                [ ":" chanstring ]
  servername =  <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">hostname</a>
  host       =  <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">hostname</a> / hostaddr
  <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">hostname</a>   =  shortname *( "." shortname )
  shortname  =  ( letter / digit ) *( letter / digit / "-" )
                *( letter / digit )
                  ; as specified in RFC 1123 [HNAME]
  hostaddr   =  ip4addr / ip6addr
  ip4addr    =  1*3digit "." 1*3digit "." 1*3digit "." 1*3digit
  ip6addr    =  1*hexdigit 7( ":" 1*hexdigit )
  ip6addr    =/ "0:0:0:0:0:" ( "0" / "FFFF" ) ":" ip4addr
  <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>   =  ( letter / special ) *8( letter / digit / special / "-" )
  targetmask =  ( "$" / "#" ) mask
                  ; see details on allowed masks in section 3.3.1
  chanstring =  %x01-07 / %x08-09 / %x0B-0C / %x0E-1F / %x21-2B
  chanstring =/ %x2D-39 / %x3B-FF
                  ; any octet except NUL, BELL, CR, LF, " ", "," and ":"
  channelid  = 5( %x41-5A / digit )   ; 5( A-Z / 0-9 )
  Other parameter syntaxes are:
  user       =  1*( %x01-09 / %x0B-0C / %x0E-1F / %x21-3F / %x41-FF )
                  ; any octet except NUL, CR, LF, " " and "@"
  key        =  1*23( %x01-05 / %x07-08 / %x0C / %x0E-1F / %x21-7F )
                  ; any 7-bit US_ASCII character,
                  ; except NUL, CR, LF, FF, h/v TABs, and " "
  letter     =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A       ; A-Z / a-z
  digit      =  %x30-39                 ; 0-9
  hexdigit   =  digit / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
  special    =  %x5B-60 / %x7B-7D
                   ; "[", "]", "\", "`", "_", "^", "{", "|", "}"
  NOTES:
      1) The &lt;hostaddr&gt; syntax is given here for the sole purpose of
         indicating the format to follow for IP addresses.  This
         reflects the fact that the only available implementations of
         this protocol uses TCP/IP as underlying network protocol but is
         not meant to prevent other protocols to be used.
      2) &lt;<a href="doc_irc_masks.html">hostname</a>&gt; has a maximum length of 63 characters.  This is a
         limitation of the protocol as internet hostnames (in
         particular) can be longer.  Such restriction is necessary
         because IRC messages are limited to 512 characters in length.
         Clients connecting from a host which name is longer than 63
         characters are registered using the host (numeric) address
         instead of the host name.
      3) Some parameters used in the following sections of this
         documents are not defined here as there is nothing specific
         about them besides the name that is used for convenience.
         These parameters follow the general syntax defined for
         &lt;params&gt;.

<b>2.4 Numeric replies</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Most of the messages sent to the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> generate a reply of some
sort.  The most common reply is the numeric reply, used for both
errors and normal replies.  The numeric reply MUST be sent as one
message consisting of the sender prefix, the three-digit numeric, and
the target of the reply.  A numeric reply is not allowed to originate
from a client. In all other respects, a numeric reply is just like a
normal message, except that the keyword is made up of 3 numeric
digits rather than a string of letters.  A list of different replies
is supplied in section 5 (Replies).
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>2.5 <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">Wildcard</a> expressions</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
When wildcards are allowed in a string, it is referred as a "mask".
<p>
For string matching purposes, the protocol allows the use of two
special characters: '?' (%x3F) to match one and only one character,
and '*' (%x2A) to match any number of any characters.  These two
characters can be escaped using the character '\' (%x5C).
<p>
<pre>
   The Augmented BNF syntax for this is:
    mask       =  *( nowild / noesc wildone / noesc wildmany )
    wildone    =  %x3F
    wildmany   =  %x2A
    nowild     =  %x01-29 / %x2B-3E / %x40-FF
                    ; any octet except NUL, "*", "?"
    noesc      =  %x01-5B / %x5D-FF
                    ; any octet except NUL and "\"
    matchone   =  %x01-FF
                    ; matches wildone
    matchmany  =  *matchone
                    ; matches wildmany
   Examples:
   a?c         ; Matches any string of 3 characters in length starting
               with "a" and ending with "c"
   a*c         ; Matches any string of at least 2 characters in length
               starting with "a" and ending with "c"

<b>3. Message Details</b>

On the following pages there are descriptions of each message
recognized by the IRC <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> and client.  All commands described in
this section MUST be implemented by any <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> for this protocol.
<p>
Where the reply ERR_NOSUCHSERVER is returned, it means that the
target of the message could not be found.  The <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> MUST NOT send
any other replies after this error for that command.
<p>
The <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> to which a client is connected is required to parse the
complete message, and return any appropriate errors.
<p>
If multiple parameters is presented, then each MUST be checked for
validity and appropriate responses MUST be sent back to the client.
In the case of incorrect messages which use parameter lists with
comma as an item separator, a reply MUST be sent for each item.

<b>3.1 Connection Registration</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
The commands described here are used to register a connection with an
IRC <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> as a user as well as to correctly disconnect.
<p>
A "PASS" command is not required for a client connection to be
registered, but it MUST precede the latter of the NICK/USER
combination (for a user connection) or the SERVICE command (for a
service connection). The RECOMMENDED order for a client to register
is as follows:
<p>
<pre>
                           1. Pass message
           2. Nick message                 2. Service message
           3. User message
</pre>
<p>
Upon success, the client will receive an RPL_WELCOME (for users) or
RPL_YOURESERVICE (for services) message indicating that the
connection is now registered and known the to the entire IRC network.
The reply message MUST contain the full client identifier upon which
it was registered.
</td></tr>

Command: USER
Parameters: &lt;user&gt; &lt;mode&gt; &lt;unused&gt; &lt;realname&gt;
The USER command is used at the beginning of connection to specify
the <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">username</a>, <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">hostname</a> and realname of a new user.
The &lt;mode&gt; parameter should be a numeric, and can be used to
automatically set user modes when registering with the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>.  This
parameter is a bitmask, with only 2 bits having any signification: if
the bit 2 is set, the user mode 'w' will be set and if the bit 3 is
set, the user mode 'i' will be set.  (See Section 3.1.5 "User
Modes").
The &lt;realname&gt; may contain space characters.

Command: MODE
Parameters: &lt;<a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>&gt;
*( ( "+" / "-" ) *( "i" / "w" / "o" / "O" / "r" ) )
The user MODE's are typically changes which affect either how the
client is seen by others or what 'extra' messages the client is sent.
A user MODE command MUST only be accepted if both the sender of the
message and the <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> given as a parameter are both the same.  If
no other parameter is given, then the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> will return the current
settings for the nick.
      The available modes are as follows:
           a - user is flagged as away;
           i - marks a users as invisible;
           w - user receives wallops;
           r - restricted user connection;
           o - <a href="doc_operators.html">operator</a> flag;
           O - local <a href="doc_operators.html">operator</a> flag;
           s - marks a user for receipt of <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> notices.
Additional modes may be available later on.
The flag 'a' SHALL NOT be toggled by the user using the MODE command,
instead use of the AWAY command is REQUIRED.
If a user attempts to make themselves an <a href="doc_operators.html">operator</a> using the "+o" or
"+O" flag, the attempt SHOULD be ignored as users could bypass the
authentication mechanisms of the OPER command.  There is no
restriction, however, on anyone `deopping' themselves (using "-o" or
"-O").
On the other hand, if a user attempts to make themselves unrestricted
using the "-r" flag, the attempt SHOULD be ignored.  There is no
restriction, however, on anyone `deopping' themselves (using "+r").
This flag is typically set by the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> upon connection for
administrative reasons.  While the restrictions imposed are left up
to the implementation, it is typical that a restricted user not be
allowed to change <a href="doc_ircintro.html">nicknames</a>, nor make use of the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel operator</a>
status on <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channels</a>.
The flag 's' is obsolete but MAY still be used.

This group of messages is concerned with manipulating <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channels</a>, their
properties (<a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> modes), and their contents (typically users).
For this reason, these messages SHALL NOT be made available to
services.
All of these messages are requests which will or will not be granted
by the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>.  The <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> MUST send a reply informing the user
whether the request was granted, denied or generated an error.  When
the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> grants the request, the message is typically sent back
(eventually reformatted) to the user with the prefix set to the user
itself.
The rules governing how <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channels</a> are managed are enforced by the
servers.  These rules are beyond the scope of this document.  More

/ "0"
The JOIN command is used by a user to request to start listening to
the specific <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a>.  Servers MUST be able to parse arguments in the
form of a list of target, but SHOULD NOT use lists when sending JOIN
messages to clients.
Once a user has joined a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a>, he receives information about
all commands his <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> receives affecting the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a>.  This
includes JOIN, MODE, KICK, PART, QUIT and of course PRIVMSG/NOTICE.
This allows <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> members to keep track of the other <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a>
members, as well as <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> modes.
If a JOIN is successful, the user receives a JOIN message as
confirmation and is then sent the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a>'s topic (using RPL_TOPIC) and
the list of users who are on the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> (using RPL_NAMREPLY), which
MUST include the user joining.
Note that this message accepts a special argument ("0"), which is
a special request to leave all <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channels</a> the user is currently a member
of.  The <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> will <a href="class_process.html">process</a> this message as if the user had sent
a PART command (See Section 3.2.2) for each <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> he is a member

The INVITE command is used to invite a user to a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a>.  The
parameter &lt;<a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>&gt; is the <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> of the person to be invited to

Only the user inviting and the user being invited will receive
notification of the invitation.  Other <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> members are not
notified.  (This is unlike the MODE changes, and is occasionally the
source of trouble for users.)

[&lt;comment&gt;]
The KICK command can be used to request the forced removal of a user

either one <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> parameter and multiple user parameter, or as many

given, this will be sent instead of the default message, the <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>

The <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> MUST NOT send KICK messages with multiple <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channels</a> or

<b>3.3 Sending messages</b>

<tr><td><pre>
The main purpose of the IRC protocol is to provide a base for clients
to communicate with each other.  PRIVMSG, NOTICE and SQUERY
(described in Section 3.5 on Service Query and Commands) are the only
messages available which actually perform delivery of a text message
from one client to another - the rest just make it possible and try
to ensure it happens in a reliable and structured manner.

<b>3.3.1 Private messages</b>

<tr><td><pre>
Command: PRIVMSG
Parameters: &lt;msgtarget&gt; &lt;text to be sent&gt;
PRIVMSG is used to send private messages between users, as well as to
send messages to <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channels</a>.  &lt;msgtarget&gt; is usually the <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> of
the recipient of the message, or a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> name.
The &lt;msgtarget&gt; parameter may also be a host mask (#&lt;mask&gt;) or <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>
mask ($&lt;mask&gt;).  In both cases the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> will only send the PRIVMSG
to those who have a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> or host matching the mask.  The mask MUST
have at least 1 (one) "." in it and no wildcards following the last
".".  This requirement exists to prevent people sending messages to
"#*" or "$*", which would broadcast to all users.  Wildcards are the
'*' and '?'  characters.  This extension to the PRIVMSG command is
only available to <a href="doc_operators.html">operators</a>.

<tr><td><pre>
Command: NOTICE
Parameters: &lt;msgtarget&gt; &lt;text&gt;
The NOTICE command is used similarly to PRIVMSG.  The difference
between NOTICE and PRIVMSG is that automatic replies MUST NEVER be
sent in response to a NOTICE message.  This rule applies to servers
too - they MUST NOT send any error reply back to the client on
receipt of a notice.  The <a href="class_object.html">object</a> of this rule is to avoid loops
between clients automatically sending something in response to
something it received.
This command is available to services as well as users.
This is typically used by services, and automatons (clients with
either an AI or other interactive program controlling their actions).

the mask, or if no mask is given, the full list is returned.
If &lt;remote <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>&gt; is given in addition to &lt;<a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> mask&gt;, the LINKS
command is forwarded to the first <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> found that matches that name
(if any), and that <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> is then required to answer the query.

Command: WHO
Parameters: [ &lt;mask&gt; [ "o" ] ]
The WHO command is used by a client to generate a query which returns
a list of information which 'matches' the &lt;mask&gt; parameter given by
the client.  In the absence of the &lt;mask&gt; parameter, all visible
(users who aren't invisible (user mode +i) and who don't have a

result can be achieved by using a &lt;mask&gt; of "0" or any <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">wildcard</a> which
will end up matching every visible user.
The &lt;mask&gt; passed to WHO is matched against users' host, <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>, real
name and <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> if the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> &lt;mask&gt; cannot be found.

<tr><td><pre>
Command: KILL
Parameters: &lt;<a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>&gt; &lt;comment&gt;
The KILL command is used to cause a client-server connection to be
closed by the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> which has the actual connection.  Servers
generate KILL messages on <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> collisions.  It MAY also be
available available to users who have the <a href="doc_operators.html">operator</a> status.
Clients which have automatic reconnect algorithms effectively make
this command useless since the disconnection is only brief.  It does
however break the flow of data and can be used to stop large amounts
of 'flooding' from abusive users or accidents.  Abusive users usually
don't care as they will reconnect promptly and resume their abusive
behaviour.  To prevent this command from being abused, any user may
elect to receive KILL messages generated for others to keep an 'eye'
on would be trouble spots.
In an arena where <a href="doc_ircintro.html">nicknames</a> are REQUIRED to be globally unique at all
times, KILL messages are sent whenever 'duplicates' are detected
(that is an attempt to register two users with the same <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>) in
the hope that both of them will disappear and only 1 reappear.
When a client is removed as the result of a KILL message, the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>
SHOULD add the <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> to the list of unavailable <a href="doc_ircintro.html">nicknames</a> in an
attempt to avoid clients to reuse this name immediately which is
usually the pattern of abusive behaviour often leading to useless
"KILL loops".  See the "IRC <a href="doc_ircintro.html">Server</a> Protocol" document [IRC-SERVER]
for more information on this procedure.
The comment given MUST reflect the actual reason for the KILL.  For
server-generated KILLs it usually is made up of details concerning
the origins of the two conflicting <a href="doc_ircintro.html">nicknames</a>.  For users it is left
up to them to provide an adequate reason to satisfy others who see
it.  To prevent/discourage fake KILLs from being generated to hide
the identify of the KILLer, the comment also shows a 'kill-path'
which is updated by each <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> it passes through, each prepending
its name to the path.

This section describes OPTIONAL messages.  They are not required in a
working <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> implementation of the protocol described herein.  In
the absence of the feature, an error reply message MUST be generated
or an unknown command error.  If the message is destined for another
<a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> to answer then it MUST be passed on (elementary parsing
REQUIRED) The allocated numerics for this are listed with the
messages below.

<b>4.1 Away</b>
</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
Command: AWAY
Parameters: [ &lt;text&gt; ]
With the AWAY command, clients can set an automatic reply string for
any PRIVMSG commands directed at them (not to a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a> they are on).
The <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> sends an automatic reply to the client sending the PRIVMSG
command.  The only replying <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> is the one to which the sending
client is connected to.
The AWAY command is used either with one parameter, to set an AWAY
message, or with no parameters, to remove the AWAY message.
Because of its high cost (memory and bandwidth wise), the AWAY
message SHOULD only be used for client-server communication.  A
<a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> MAY choose to silently ignore AWAY messages received from
other servers.  To update the away status of a client across servers,
the user mode 'a' SHOULD be used instead.  (See Section 3.1.5)

Command: REHASH
Parameters: None
The rehash command is an administrative command which can be used by

Command: DIE
Parameters: None
An <a href="doc_operators.html">operator</a> can use the DIE command to shutdown the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>.  This
message is optional since it may be viewed as a risk to allow
arbitrary people to connect to a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> as an <a href="doc_operators.html">operator</a> and execute
this command.
The DIE command MUST always be fully processed by the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> to which

<tr><td><pre>
Command: SUMMON
Parameters: &lt;user&gt; [ &lt;target&gt; [ &lt;<a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a>&gt; ] ]
The SUMMON command can be used to give users who are on a host
running an IRC <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> a message asking them to please join IRC.  This
message is only sent if the target <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> (a) has SUMMON enabled, (b)
the user is logged in and (c) the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> <a href="class_process.html">process</a> can write to the
user's tty (or similar).
If no &lt;<a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>&gt; parameter is given it tries to summon &lt;user&gt; from the
<a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> the client is connected to is assumed as the target.
If summon is not enabled in a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>, it MUST return the
ERR_SUMMONDISABLED numeric.

<b>4.6 Users</b>

<tr><td><pre>
Command: USERS
Parameters: [ &lt;target&gt; ]
The USERS command returns a list of users logged into the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> in a
format similar to the UNIX commands who(1), rusers(1) and finger(1).
If disabled, the correct numeric MUST be returned to indicate this.
Because of the security implications of such a command, it SHOULD be
disabled by default in <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> implementations.  Enabling it SHOULD
require recompiling the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> or some equivalent change rather than
simply toggling an option and restarting the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>.  The procedure
to enable this command SHOULD also include suitable large comments.

<b>4.7 Operwall message</b>

<tr><td><pre>
Command: WALLOPS
Parameters: &lt;Text to be sent&gt;
The WALLOPS command is used to send a message to all currently
connected users who have set the 'w' user mode for themselves.  (See
Section 3.1.5 "User modes").
After implementing WALLOPS as a user command it was found that it was
often and commonly abused as a means of sending a message to a lot of
people.  Due to this, it is RECOMMENDED that the implementation of
WALLOPS allows and recognizes only servers as the originators of
WALLOPS.

<tr><td><pre>
Command: ISON
Parameters: &lt;<a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>&gt; *( SPACE &lt;<a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>&gt; )
The ISON command was implemented to provide a quick and efficient
means to get a response about whether a given <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> was currently
on IRC. ISON only takes one (1) type of parameter: a space-separated
list of nicks.  For each <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> in the list that is present, the
<a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> adds that to its reply string.  Thus the reply string may
return empty (none of the given nicks are present), an exact copy of
the parameter string (all of them present) or any other subset of the
set of nicks given in the parameter.  The only limit on the number of
nicks that may be checked is that the combined length MUST NOT be too
large as to cause the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> to chop it off so it fits in 512
characters.
ISON is only processed by the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> local to the client sending the
command and thus not passed onto other servers for further
processing.

           response to a TRACE command traversing the IRC
           network should reflect the actual connectivity of
           the servers themselves along that path.
           RPL_TRACENEWTYPE is to be used for any connection
           which does not fit in the other categories but is

<b>6. Current implementations</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
The IRC software, version 2.10 is the only complete implementation of
the IRC protocol (client and <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>).  Because of the small amount of
changes in the client protocol since the publication of RFC 1459
[IRC], implementations that follow it are likely to be compliant with
this protocol or to require a small amount of changes to reach
compliance.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>7. Current problems</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
There are a number of recognized problems with the IRC Client
Protocol, and more generally with the IRC <a href="doc_ircintro.html">Server</a> Protocol.  In order
to preserve backward compatibility with old clients, this protocol
has almost not evolved since the publication of RFC 1459 [IRC].
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>7.1 Nicknames</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
The idea of the <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> on IRC is very convenient for users to use
when talking to each other outside of a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">channel</a>, but there is only a
finite <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> space and being what they are, it's not uncommon for
several people to want to use the same nick.  If a <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> is chosen
by two people using this protocol, either one will not succeed or
both will removed by use of a <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> KILL (See Section 3.7.1).
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>7.2 Limitation of wildcards</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
There is no way to escape the escape character "\" (%x5C).  While
this isn't usually a problem, it makes it impossible to form a mask
with a backslash character ("\") preceding a <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">wildcard</a>.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<b>7.3 Security considerations</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Security issues related to this protocol are discussed in the "IRC
<a href="doc_ircintro.html">Server</a> Protocol" [IRC-SERVER] as they are mostly an issue for the
<a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> side of the connection.
