    <td>Here, you can configure the CTCP flood protection system.<br>
The CTCP engine in <a href="doc_rfc2812.html">IRC</a> clients may be subject to an attack, called "CTCP flooding".<br>
Basically, the attackers (usually there is more than one offending client) sends a stream
of CTCP requests to the victim's client, and the client attempts to respond to all requests
by sending a stream of replies to the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a>, which causes the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> to disconnect the user
due to "excess flood" for sending too many messages before the <a href="doc_ircintro.html">server</a> can <a href="class_process.html">process</a> them.<br>
Many user defined scripts choose to completely ignore all the CTCP requests in order to prevent such attacks.<br>
<a href="doc_kvircintro.html">KVIrc</a> offers an alternative method that allows you to take advantage of the CTCP <a href="doc_rfc2812.html">protocol</a>
and at the same time prevent the flood attacks.<br>
The method is really simple: The client will only respond to a limited number of CTCP requests within a
specified time interval.<br>
The "Use flood protection" option enables this protection method.<br>
In the "Allowed up to" field you should enter the maximum number of CTCP requests that <a href="doc_kvircintro.html">KVIrc</a> should
respond to within the interval of time defined in the second field.<br>
A strong protection against floods would be replying to 4 requests every 20 seconds.<br>
The minimum effective setting is about 3 messages every 6 seconds.<br>
Please note that 3 messages every 6 seconds is NOT the same as 10 messages every 20 seconds;
the first setting would allow 3 requests within one second, but the client would
ignore all the requests for the next 5 seconds, the second setting would allow 10 messages within one second
and ignore everything for the next 19 seconds. Therefore, 3/6 is a safer setting.<br>
The maximum protection you can set is 0 messages within any number of seconds; in that case any
CTCP request will be considered a flood and ignored.<br>
<br><br>
You can also decide to ignore specific CTCP requests. For example, if you don't want to reply to PING
requests, just select "PING" under the "Ignored Requests" section.<br>
<br><br>
Some specific protection options can be set also in other CTCP options sections:
see the <a href="widget_ctcpavatarprotooptions.html">ctcp avatar protocol options</a> and <a href="widget_ctcpdccprotooptions.html">ctcp dcc protocol options</a>.<br>
