To translate the site just follows these rules:

1) Get the lastest Git version of the site. To do that simply run
   git clone https://github.com/kvirc/kvirc-www

2) If your language file does not exists, create it using English one
   cp locale_en.php locale_XX.php
   where XX is your language code

3) Edit your file. To do that simply remove English strings and
   replace them with strings in your language. Pay attention to special
   characters as \" or \$ or the translation won't work as expected.
   You MUST USE UTF-8 as coding standard, so make sure your editor will
   use it when saving the translation file.

4) When you're satisfied with your translation file, open a pull request on the repo.
