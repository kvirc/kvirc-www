	You can translate *.po files using a simple text editor (that <b>HAVE</b> to support the UTF-8 encoding), but it's strongly advised that you use a translation software such as lokalize for Linux/kde or poedit for Windows.";

	The msgid can contain html tags, escapes like \"\\n\" and format strings like \"%s\". You <b>MUST</b> match the tags, escapes and format specs in the msgstr strings. Keep special attention to the format specifications (%s, %W, %Q, ...).<br />

	You need to force the build system to pick up your newly created translation files and compile it. This is again an one time step.

	This procedure will update your *_xxx.po files with the new messages and mark the old messages as either fuzzy or invalid.<br />

	If you're in doubt about some translation, you could take a look at how similar sentences have been translated in the KDE *.po files, or in other software. If you need some further help, contact us on our mailing list or on IRC (irc://irc.freenode.net/#KVIrc).";

	When you're satisfied with your translation, you can either send your *.po files to the KVIrc mailing list asking for inclusion in the Git repository, or commit and push to your own Git fork.
